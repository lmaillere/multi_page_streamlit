# Multipage web app for population dynamics models

This work is a detailed implementation of a multipage web app able to represent and simulate some classical 1D population dynamics models. Parameters are fixed, and the initial condition can be set by the user through a slider.

Implemented models are:
- the logistic model (page 1)
- a form of Allee effects model (page 2)

This work is based on classical Python modules, including `streamlit`, and the `streamlit-multipage-framework`:

It is intended to serve as a basis for more complicated population dynamics web apps development.
